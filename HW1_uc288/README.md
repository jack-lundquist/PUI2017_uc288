## Assignment 1 - Finish Lab
GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/unissechua/gittest_uc288](https://github.com/unissechua/gittest_uc288)

For completing the lab, I paired up with Nina Nurrahmawati (nn1221) to complete the fork and merge with a pull request.

Afterwards, Christian Moscardi (clm633) was looking for partner to complete the fork and merge portion so I did that again with him.

## Assignment 2 - Setting up the environment
For setting up the environment variable and alias, I was able to complete the steps on my own.
