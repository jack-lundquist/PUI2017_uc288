| Statistical Analyses | Dependent Variables | Independent Variables | Control Variables | Question Answered |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ANCOVA | Brain mass, Testis mass, Mass dimorphism (log transformed)| Mating system, Female promiscuity | Body mass | Do differences exist between 2 or more groups after controlling for CVs on one DV? |
| Path Analysis | 2+ continuous | 1+ countinuous | 0 | What are the direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on the DV? |
| Logistic Regression | 1+ categorical or continuous | 1 dichotomous | 0 |  What is the odds probability of the DV occurring as the values of IVs change?|
