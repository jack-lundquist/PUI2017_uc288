| ANCOVA  | 1, type of game played (Brain Age or Tetris) | categorical | 1, the change in scores | continuous | 1, pre-training score | continuous | Does playing brain training games boost the cognitive functions of the player? | Change in *Brain Age* group <= Change in *Tetris* group | 0.05 | [Brain Training Game Boosts Executive Functions, Working Memory and Processing Speed in the Young Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0055518)
| Correlation | 1, Intra-abnominal pressure (IAP) | continuous | 1, Extracellular water content (ECW) | continuous | 0 | n/a | How strongly does IAP correlate with ECW? | Intra-abnominal pressure (IAP) is not correlated with extracellular water content (ECW) | 0.05 | [Intra-Abdominal Pressure Correlates with Extracellular Water Content](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122193)
| Logistic Regression | 1, community size | continuous | 1, absence/presence of critical scalar stress | dichotomous | 0 | n/a | What is the probability that a group experienced critical scalar stress? | Lower probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress are associated with smaller group sizes and higher probabilities with larger group sizes | 0.05 | [Modeling Group Size and Scalar Stress by Logistic Regression from an Archaeological Perspective](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510)
