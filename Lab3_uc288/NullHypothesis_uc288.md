## Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**
The difference in body fat percentage is significantly lower or the same for the test sample on a 1,500 calorie diet as compared to the test sample on a 3 times a week 1-hour cardio exercise regime.

**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**
The difference in body fat percentage is significantly higher for the test sample on a 1,500 calorie diet as compared to the test sample on a 3 times a week 1-hour cardio exercise regime.

### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**
The average IQ of children from 1-4 years old whose mothers smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day during the pregnancy period is significantly higher than the average IQ of children of the same age group whose mothers do not smoke.

**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**
The average IQ of children from 1-4 years old whose mothers smoked at least 10 cigarettes a day during the pregnancy period is significantly lower than the average IQ of children of the same age group whose mothers do not smoke.

### Food desserts ontribute to the incidence of diabetes
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

**Null Hypothesis (H0)**


**Alternative Hypothesis (Ha)**
